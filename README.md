# Exploratory data analysis of  Prosper Loan Data

## Abstract 

[Prosper](https://www.prosper.com) which was founded in 2005 is a peer-to-peer lending platform that people can invest in each other. Prosper connects people who need money with those who have money to invest. In this project, I explore a Prosper dataset, which can be found at this [link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1496756846241000&usg=AFQjCNElEYjVf30dH0pH07Q-YkyjDNIt0g).
